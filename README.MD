# Goal of the Project was to get understanding of branching different clones and then Merging one of them with the master
### In our specific case we made RedTheme and BlueTheme styles for the same html file and merged Red Theme with the master in the end
### Subsequently we delted both the branches and loaded the master to the repository
### **Important** is to note that we _Did NoT_ write the _HTML_ file afresh but imported the one from our work early in the day
### We imported an _HTML_ file that list the favorite places for us and we have the photographs of Multnomah falls and Willamete River in that and just played with the styles file in the **css* directory to change the color themes.
# Purpose of learning how to branch and merge was achied. Though practicing on text editor and practicing on HTML files need attention for the weekend
